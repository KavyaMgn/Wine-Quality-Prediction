## Problem
Predict wine quality (`high_quality`: 1 = high quality, 0 = not) using physicochemical features like alcohol %, pH, acidity, sulphates, and sugar levels.  

---

## Method
- Dataset: **Wine Quality (UCI ML Repository)**, 1,599 samples.  
- Model: **Decision Tree Classifier**.  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.  

---

## Results
- Accuracy: **85%**  
- Precision: **80%**  
- Recall: **78%**  
- Key predictors: Alcohol %, pH < 3.2, Sulphates.  

---

## Future Work
- Extend with **Random Forest / Ensembles** for >90% accuracy.  
- Build a **Streamlit app** for interactive predictions.
